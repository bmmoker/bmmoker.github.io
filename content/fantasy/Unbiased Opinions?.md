# Unbiased Opinions?
*There are much more important things to be done but I must give the people what they want*

## Take 2
Well, I am a little late to the game with the write ups, call it frustration and lack of motivation as the standings reflect. We return for the thrill of the game, the competition that fuels us all, and of course…the 3-foot tall trophy that is currently sitting to my left. She is a beaut. I will confess I am looking for a repeat, but playoffs come first. Can I even talk about playoffs after my week one performance?

## Where the hell are we?
And that is a great question. Expanding the league to 10 teams add for increased competition and a thinner pool to pick from. For example, when you try to pick up a few rookie studs that would have 1000% been on the waiver wire after week one last year but you find out they have **ALL** been drafted. Yeah, I’m looking at you Julia. In addition to that we are now in Week 4 of the regular season and the standings have started to take shape. There are some surprises and some unlucky breaks and then some absolute garbage![garbage](/trash.gif)

## Standings:

A quick look at the standings we see that IGT is sitting *pretty* in first with a 3-0 record and leading GST on Points For. Then almost half the league is at 2-1 clamoring for a spot at the top, led by MFBWU with 426 points for almost 40 points above the next closest competitor, EDW. RR (*super original name*) on the outside looking in at the top 6 at 1-2.  And rounding out the rest of the slumps are the final 3 teams trying to avoid becoming the next Lucky Day

## Preview Week 4
**Le Freak vs GurlSkittCookies**

- 2 devastating losses in a row after not getting anything week 1 has LFCZ trying to scramble for a win.![scramble for a win](/spongebob_ineedit.gif)
- GSC has ripped off a quick start to the season with a 3 game win streak.
- The QB advantage will slightly favor GSC
	- even though the browns are the tougher defense, Lamar always has the potential to run
- WRs are pretty even, the favor goes to Le Freak since Teddy Bridges is starting for MT
- RBs have to favor GSC due to prior experiences, tough matchups for Zeke and Montgomery might spell doom for C’est Zeke
- Prediction: Gotta be optimistic and believe I can pull off an upset…but it’ll be close
	- LFCZ -3

**Cooks the Books vs MayTheFieldBWithU**

- 2 2-1 teams go head to head in what looks to be a close match up on paper
- MFBWU is the leading scorer in the league and will look to add to his lead
- Dak vs NO could have been bigger than what it will be but the hook up with Cooper gives MFBWU the advantage in the QB and WR room since OBJ seems to be the only Brown WR showing up. ![Dak](/dak.gif)
- The Depth at RB for CtB could be key here as Ekeler slips in for Bell who is on a bye but there should not be a step down.
- This game may come down to the TE and flex positions as the edge for TE goes to MFBWU but you have to like Flash’s upside in the FLEX if Jules can’t go
- Gotta go with the leading scorer since the matchups shake out pretty evenly
	- MFBWU -5

**I gotta Thielen vs Julia’s Team**

- so JT does have the worse team name and, like IGT learned last year it’s best to change it.  Now to the Game
- This game may be closer than it seems with Russ at Arizona, but Goff vs Tampa could either be huge or detrimental thanks to a Todd Bowles D
- Gotta like JT’s receivers this week **IF** Jules can play since both IGT’s receivers will be playing in not so ideal conditions
- It’s a different story with the RBs in this game as the Raiders have floundered since week 1 and Josh Jacobs needs a shot in the arm
- Half McCaf and Kerryon My Wayward Son should be enough to propel IGT, sprinkled with the arrival of Phillip Lindsay last week.
	- IGT -6

**Redzone Reindeers vs James White Claw**

- Second Worse team name and subject to punishment, is the RedzoneReindeers. (I will give you the name DeathBy1000Lutz for free, and yes..it fits).
- This one should be pretty straight forward as Mahomes picked up where he left off and is still **ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT** ![crushing it](/mahomes.gif) and he's got that Kelce hook up
- Silver lining for JWC is that Mecole will hopefully steal some of those points but unfortunately Hill is still sidelined
- The depth at receiver keeps JWC in the game but the potential lack of RB depth and lower projections could hurt him in the long run
	- JWC will need to go balls to the Waller
- The RBs should be the push DB1000L over the top and of course if Lutz keeps bombing field goals
	- RR - 10

**ElementaryDearWatson vs LandryInMyHamper**

- Probably the most fitting team name, idk if LIMH ever takes his clothes out of the hamper
- this looks to be a good matchup but the injury to Saquon puts EDW on the edge
- LIMH has a solid starting line up but lacks elite depth and needs his Landry to starting taking it to the basket., aka the end zone if he is going to survive the season
- There is not mention about defenses, but Chicago D and Pats D are huge difference makers that can win games and championships.
- EDW will need to rely on Danny Dime’s connection to Evan Engram to pull off a potential upset.
- I think Saquon hurts too much
	- LIMH -7

## Final Thoughts:
I put the write up here thanks to the creative flexibility it gives me. Eventually, I hope to add comments. But for now, add all trash talking to the forum and do not go clicking around. Trust me, nothing works besides this post and 2 links.
