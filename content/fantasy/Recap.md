## A brief poem from the office of the FNC
_An Ode to Joy_

It’s that time of year  
The time, oh the time, that brings us all cheer  
Except for a select few  
Who’s paths unluckily did not stay true  
To the mission, the climb  
An entire season and no phone chimes  
But alas, as more will join you  
As only one team can complete the coup  
Or will it stay close and near?  
For losing the trophy, I do not fear  

_Friendly Neighborhood Commissioner_

## Oh the humanity
The dust is starting to settle and there are figures emerging from the cloud. 6 teams stand strong going into the first week of the playoffs. For all that hard work, we are rewarded with a pseudo-bye week as we have only 2 games to enjoy.

Blink and you may have missed it, here’s what happened:

### 10 - I’m Folked
* Projected Finish: 8th
* Actual Finish: 10th
* Record 4-9

Starting off 0-5 will always be tough to come back from, but there were moments and signs with 4 straight weeks of 100+ points and a stretch of 5/6. The team’s hopes were dashed when he ran into the freight train known as Le Freak and then the rabbit in the hat that was Life’s a Brees in back to back weeks sending IF to 2-7.

### 09 - Just a Little Chub
* Projected Finish: 9th
* Actual Finish: 9th
* Record 4-9

Another team to start the season 0-3 but still had a chance mid season to turn on. But just like I’m folked ran out of gas, and had to have Max try to drag the team up to the summit of Mt Crumpit. Unfortunately, Max could only drag one Grinch to the top (more on that later). After climbing back to 2-3, a string of 6 straight losses slowly chipped away at the team. Put up 10 100+ games but could only win 4, is it a fluke? We’ll have to see next season

### 08 - LandryInMyHamper
* Projected Finish: 6th
* Actual Finish: 8th
* Record 6-7

And now we get to the contenders, the teams that by the skin of their teeth just missed out on the final tournament. Or should we call this one a Super bowl hangover? Finishing second sucks and it’s easy to lose motivation. After a strong start of 3-1, a demoralizing streak of 3 losses and 5/6 in the thick of the race doomed the team as injuries were abound. A loss in the last week was the nail in the coffin

### 07 - Baby Chark
* Projected Finish: 3rd
* Actual Finish: 7th
* Record 6-7

Another close call that a loss in the last week doomed and another team that was devastated by injuries to multiple starters. Baby Chark did well to start 4-1 but suffered the same fate as LiMH with a streak of 5 losses in 6 in the heat of the race. Splitting the last two games was not enough

### 06 - Dak Dak
* Projected Finish: 2nd
* Actual Finish: 6th
* Record 6-7

Enter your finalists. After torching the start of the season but staggering out to a 2-3 record you could call dak dak a little unlucky.  Things started to regress as 4 straight weeks of peaking out at 102 hurt their chances and only passing that point once after week 6. A sloppy game in week 13 helped DD stumble into the playoffs

### 05 - Life’s a brees
* Projected Finish: 10th
* Actual Finish: 5th
* Record 7-6

This one gets a gif:

This one doesn’t make sense. The least points for was sitting at 7-4 at one point and still somehow finished with more points for than points against. A late 3 game win streak where and 2 wins in 4 weeks despite putting up less than 100 points is still feat within itself. I guess true randomness is a good plan since you can’t prepare for it

### 04 - ElementaryDearWatson
* Projected Finish: 5th
* Actual Finish: 4th
* Record 7-6

Could never get the right consistency down to get a higher seed but there was a chance after dropping 180 and 165 in 4 weeks. But that bookended 2 losses with an average score of just 100. A win over LiMH booked their ticket to the show and could be a late sleeper

### 03 - RedzoneReindeers
* Projected Finish: 1st
* Actual Finish: 3rd
* Record 8-5

Somehow, someway Yahoo thought this was a 12-1 team. 12-1 in a 10 man league sounds pretty ridiculous just given the amount of heartbreak that fantasy can cause. Needless to say, the Reindeers dropped Santa’s sled and could not deliver the goods. Owner of the second longest win streak of the season vaulted RR from unlucky start to second place at their peak. 2 losses in the final 3 weeks dropped them to 3rd and have to fight for a spot in the top 4

### 02 - GurlSkittCookies
* Projected Finish: 4th
* Actual Finish: 2nd
* Record 8-5

The points for champion finished the last 9 weeks scoring more than 100 points. They sprinted out to a 7-1 record helping them clinch the playoffs early, maybe a little too early as they then proceeded to drop 4 out of the last 5 games and 3 in a row. Tough tough way to end the season by losing by .02 and then the battle for the number one seed in weeks 12/13

### 01 - Le Freak C’est Zeke
* Projected Finish: 7th
* Actual Finish: 1st
* Record 9-4

Freak out!

It’s not over but I have been waiting a long time for this one. After an 0-3 start to the season, the rumors roamed, the haters hated, the doubters doubted. _#washedup_ was trending on twitter yet when the clock struck midnight, Le Freak had the golden slipper of best record (and if you don’t think that If I lose the trophy that I won’t get an engraved glass slipper you are our of your mind). After the 3rd loss, Le Freak was trending in the right direction and tore off a 6 game win streak until a fluke loss in week 10 thanks to a Kupp goose egg. Well then until finishing strong with 3 straight wins to close the season with a 9-1 record over the last 10 games and the least amount of games under 100 (2).


## Playoff Predictions
* Dak Dak vs Reindeers
Give me Dak Dak over Reindeers. The Reindeers are banged up and riding on the banged up steelers. Dak Dak can always put up points
* ElementaryDearWatson vs Life’s a Brees
I’ll take EDW for the same reason as I’m taking Dak Dak and this team can explode and I think there’s one in them. Also see post on LaB and their scoring woes
* _update:_ as of the original writing these were my predictions and barring a huge night from Barkley I will be 0-2 with these

## and a special thanks to…
Max

I mean look at this guy:
![Max](/MaxCute.gif)

He could only carry one team from the depths of the winless cave all the way to the top of Mt Crumpit with the singular goal of cutting the roast beast. And that was me (sorry to jalc and IF). But it’s important to take a moment and appreciate those who do the right thing, which is why IMO, Max is the real reason Christmas was saved and the real hero of _Dr. Seuss’s Hoe the Grinch Stole Christmas_. One could argue that he staged the events of the movie in order to show the Grinch what Christmas really means, slowly planting ideas in The Grinch’s head, reminding him how much he hates Christmas. Which then drives the grinch to committing the ultimate heist. He goes as far as dragging the goods upit to Crumpit (he’s committed to the cause, that’s dedication right there). $5 he knew The Who’s would who a triumphant Welcome Christmas ( the fahoo fores song) and the Grinch would realize what it means to Christmas.

Be Like Max

Bonus content:

We can see below that given the amount of energy that the grinch would have had to use to pull the sled back would have to be very large. So large that it would be incredibly tough to maintain balance when the sled swung to the other side while going over his head. Being such a good boy, Max is aware to jump and grab the sled, changing it’s directory and stabilizing it. Thus saving Christmas
