# The Journey

## The first leg

The initial set up of the site involved using a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet (here is my [referral code](https://m.do.co/c/e7cce98bebca) for $50 over 30 days). From there I used a Nginx web sever and Ghost as the main blogging application. It took my about 2 days to fully set it up after work and I was able to edit the  background and create a few posts and tabs. This was way back in February and was pretty seamless. This decision was made as a quick and easy way to get a site up and running. Unfortunately I found myself liking the under the hood set up and once ghost was up I found that I did not know enough about handlebars.js and didn't like the documentation that was out there. (_full disclosure: this is a fly by the seat of my pants situation and there is ***A LOT*** that I do not know about what I attempt to do. But that's the fun part_)

Below is essentially me through this entire process and going forward:
