# When Customer Service meets Customer Service
## My experience on the other side..

So instead of trying to write a technical piece, I thought it would be a wonderful delight to write about something a little more carefree. I work in support, I know how miserable that can be. It can also be great, gratifying when you solve an issue, maybe even a some gossip to pass the day (I was once on the phone with a mother, who's daughter walked by Jalen Hurts, WHILE WE WERE ON THE PHONE! ...insane). But that's not why I'm here, Jalen ended up leaving Bama and that was it. Today, I'm here for the customer service, from a historically bad customer service company, who after much chagrin, I have decided to change in an attempt to remain neutral(I will keep it vague by using company and services).

## Where to begin

I honestly believe it happened a year ago, when I first set up the account. I tried signing in but it would not let me, and I mean would not. Everywhere I went it would give me different error messages or endless loops. So I reluctantly called, not the biggest fan of calling support unless I absolutely have to. One of those guys that likes to fix it if he can, or sometimes, if it's a not so great idea, tuck it away. I had no chose the first time I called a year ago. Do not remember why in the slightest, so I'll assume payment methods or something. Maybe a router set up? Not important. What is important is that I called. The only thing I remembered from the call is being told that there was no username tied to the account but I could sign in with A username. I was like ok weird but whatevs I created a username and that was done. Or was I?

## 1 year later
### (you should have heard it like this*)

So obviously signed up for a one-year deal and forgot.
