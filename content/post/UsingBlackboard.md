# Blackboard, an LMS

## Background and Goals

I have endeavored on a yearlong adventure into the foray of teaching and now is the time to start to make some changes to the course. The current LMS that we use at the University is Blackboard as of right now. Since the content is the same, my goal with this project is trying out how to spice up the content a little more and try to fully implement what Blackboard can do(or at least to the best of my ability).

## Some more background

I have been using Blackboard from the student perspective for quite some time now and also have work supporting it in my day job. It fits some needs, can be customized to reflect how you want to divide the course on a higher level. A side bar that allows quick access to content and grades. I thought to myself can there be more? Is this something that I can use to become more of a resource hub instead of just tossing up the course content and being done with it. What else is available that may also improve student/professor communication?

Initially, this lead me down the path of Learning Modules and Lesson Plans (actual options in Bb). After looking into these options and seeing some examples in different courses, I figured this would be a good place to start to help to clump the chapters/weeks of the course together. What I then began to realize is the amount of more research I would have to do when it came to learning how to learn. What are these methods(incidentally I bought a book on it but never read it, a common theme)? This was more event when deciding on a lesson plan. I have never even made a lesson plan before so absolutely no idea where to start.

## Where to begin?

### setting up a lesson plan

A brief skim of the [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Lesson-Plan) proved to be very enlightening and easy to follow on a shorter timeline than I had initially hoped. I decided to use a repetition based model where I try to reiterate the various steps of the way while also providing different avenues to learn.

The set up would be an individual Learning Module per week. Each learning module would contain the following:

- Lesson Plan
  - Objective of the week
  - Review from last week
  - start the first level
    - Review level and tie in to objectives
  - continue another level
  - Freestyle
    - this would be an activity that gets out of the book
  - Questions and Review

This would be the template for the daily classes without getting into the specifics.

I came across an article from [Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/blog/teaching-strategies/) that focused on teaching strategies. The article is subdivided into 3 sections (Classroom, Math, Student-focused) and based on my needs I decided to focus on what the section Classroom Teaching Strategies had to offer. There were some that I had to nix right away(it's in a computer classroom so the flexible seating was not realistic, it's easier to use the same computer over and over again). Others stuck out a little more and those include:

- Webb's Depth of Knowledge
- Summative assessment
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- Some degree of additional active learning

[Webb's Depth of Knowledge](https://www.prodigygame.com/blog/webbs-depth-of-knowledge-dok/) was one that stuck out to me and that could be because of the name. Webb's DoK goes through 4 levels from simply reciting to a real world issue, mixing in various subjects. The following section will be trying to get that into Blackboard and trying to have it run behind the scenes so it doesn't feel like blunt force trauma for the students.
